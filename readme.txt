== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is display page settings? =

You can choose on which pages the voting button should be displayed. You can uncheck "Display the button on the front page (home)" to not display it on frontpage.
Then it will just display on pages and posts.
The description is pretty straightforward and I don't think anyone would need any further explanation

= What does position settings do? =

You can choose where to display the button in your content. Should it be before the content, after the content or both before and after.

= What does globally enabled shortcode do? =

Suppose you unchecked all 3 display page settings so that the button doesn't appear anywhere but you still want the
shortcodes to work, globally enabled shortcodes would do the exact thing. Only selecting 'Enabled' would not make the 
shortcodes work on disabled display pages.

= What does the styling do? =

You can use CSS styles that surround the div containing the button. This allows you to style most of the things about the button like
alignment - left or right or center, margins etc.

= What about button styles? What does it do? =

You can choose to types of buttons to display from. You can check those out [here](http://www.dzone.com/links/buttons.jsp).

= What does compatibility mode do? =

This plugins break the some themes due to the javascript nature. You can enable compatibility mode to display the iframe instead of javascript.
This is only recommended for those who have problems with the plugin breaking their theme.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screenshot is of a button displayed before the content on right side with 'tall' button style.
2. This screenshot shows wide style button 'after' the content on the left side (using the style).
